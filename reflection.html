            <h2>06_R1_BANAWA</h2>
            <p>What I have experienced in our first week of class, not a typical type of introducing yourself in the
              front of class but we introduced our self by creating a Trello account and other type of website that will
              help us in class. About the telling of our favorite application, each one of us have different
              application, it
              depends on our daily activities or what we have liked to do. Now, I have new ideas in the application
              that they shared and maybe I will install it because somehow it is useful for me. We also talked about
              design, we shared different meaning about design. For me, design is not only to make things look good,
              appealing or for its usability rather it should have a purpose and should have deep meaning to the users.

            <p>What I have learned in Need Finding and paper prototyping, while we are collaborating to each
              other and brainstorming about the app that we need to develop, it is important to find a
              problem first before going to the solution without knowing the problem. The problem within
              our group, we find the solution first, that is why we have a problem in presenting our idea. The
              app the we will develop is a hospital finder, which user can find the nearest hospital and the
              vacancy of every hospital, if its full or not.</p>

            <h2>06_R3_BANAWA</h2>
            <p>In making my first web application in User Design class, for me, I did not find it difficult because I’ve already been making a web application when I was in Senior High in APC. They taught me basic JavaScript programming, database system and bootstrap, that is why I didn’t have any issue in making my web application. But still, I need to learn more about making a web application because technology evolved so fast, and it is important the we learn new technology.

              This is my first time using Heroku and using a GitHub repository, it is useful for web developer to test their static HTML web pages and I can view my application through Heroku app. Still, I need to improve my design, add some navigation, proper color, typography and put some images. In order to make a good web application, it should be easy to understand and user-friendly because you’re not the only one who will access your website, in the future it can be your customers, or it depends on your audience.
              
              Overall, it is fun, and I enjoy making my web application because it helps me to recall my knowledge about web development.</p>

            <p>I thought our quiz would be a typical quiz like other subjects, when I opened the userinyerface website, I don’t know how it works or the mechanics of the game. Then I understand that this quiz is like a puzzle that you need to solve to go to another level. The technic in this quiz is you need to read the instructions and use your logic to solve the problem. In my first attempt, I’ve finished the quiz in six minutes and nine seconds, which is not bad because some of my classmates finished it in 10 minutes above.

              Since our class is all about user interface, I learned that we have to design our interface properly and make it simple so that the user will not have a problem in using your application, just like what happened to me, I got frustrated in userinyerface because I don’t what should I clicked and it keeps having an error. So, the moral lesson in this quiz is we should create a good user interface so that the users can properly use the application.</p>
